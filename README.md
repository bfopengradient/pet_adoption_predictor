pet_adoption_predictor:
 
Repo contains two .py files and a jupyter notebook. The notebook is used for illustrative purposes to call in the classes from the two .py files and it runs the
algorithm to predict pet adoption rates. I cited the work of the data scientists in the notebook. Their original work made my life easier in terms of creating 
a feature set and predictor matrix for the algorithm. The algorithm I used for this exerciser was taken from work I had undertaken in a different domain and was designed for a natural language processing classification task.    

There is absolutely a simpler less complex neural net solution for this exercise.
