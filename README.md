pet_adoption_predictor:
 
Repo contains two .py files and a jupyter notebook. The notebook is used for illustrative purposes to call in the classes from the two .py files and it runs the
algorithm to predict pet adoption rates. 

I cited the work of the data scientists in the notebook whose dataset and feature set i decided to work with. Their original work made my life easier in terms of creating my feature set and predictor matrix. The algorithm I used for this exerciser was taken from work I had undertaken in a different domain and was designed for a natural language processing classification task.    

There is absolutely a simpler less complex solution for this exercise. The objective here was to see how this model would behave on this classification task after I
had addressed sparsity in the predictor matrix.
