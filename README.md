pet_adoption_predictor:
 
Repo contains two .py files and a jupyter notebook. The notebook is used for illustrative purposes to call in the classes from the two .py files and then run the
algorithm to predict pet adoption rates. 

I cited the work of the data scientists in the notebook whose dataset and feature set I decided to work with. Their original work made my life easier in terms of creating my feature set and predictor matrix. The structure of the algorithm was similar to one I had used for a natural language processing task to classify sentences. 

The objective here was to see how this model would behave on this classification task after I had addressed sparsity in the predictor matrix.
